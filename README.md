To view and run our code, first install Android Studio: http://developer.android.com/sdk/. Then, open or import the project code into the program. From there, you can use “Run App” under the “Run” menu to test in the built-in emulator or connect your own Android device. You may need to build the project first (using the “Build” menu). A screenshot of Android Studio’s “Run” menu is below.

To rotate the emulator between portrait and landscape mode, you can use Ctrl+F11 (or fn+Ctrl+F11 on OS X). When running the game, use the emulator’s back button to return to the previous screen.
