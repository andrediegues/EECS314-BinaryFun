<h1>Learn Binary &amp; Hexadecimal</h1>

<p>Binary and hexadecimal are number systems, just like decimal. Decimal is base ten, which means that it uses ten characters (0 through 9) and each digit is worth ten times the one to the right (e.g. &ldquo;10&rdquo; is ten times as much as &ldquo;1&rdquo;). Binary is base two: is uses two characters (0 and 1) and each digit is worth twice as much as the one to the right (e.g. &ldquo;10&rdquo; is double the value of &ldquo;1&rdquo;). Hexadecimal is base sixteen: it uses sixteen characters (0-9 and A-F, representing numbers 0 through 15) and each digit is worth sixteen times the one to the right (e.g. &ldquo;10&rdquo; is sixteen times &ldquo;1&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Binary is useful for computers because transistors have two states, which can represent &ldquo;1&rdquo; (on) and &ldquo;0&rdquo; (off). A series of transistors can hold longer binary numbers, which can represent data. Hexadecimal is a useful way for people to represent binary, because it is easy to convert between base 2 and 16.</p>

<p>The table below shows the conversion patterns between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal. Notice how one hexadecimal character corresponds to exactly four binary characters.</p>
