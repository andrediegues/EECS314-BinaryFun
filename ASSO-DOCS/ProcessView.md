In our game the player can choose to participate in a multiplayer mode or a single player mode. 
After choosing the desired mode the player is presented with a menu and he can choose between tutorials or to pick a game.
If the player picks a game, it can be in single or multiplayer mode, he will go into a different section, a Play Zone (the game he chose).
