If you have any doubts about the games you can access Learn Binary, Learn Logic, Learn Arithmetic and Learn Representations for more explanations and help.
The games consist in timed exercises in which you a have to make calculus, depending on the game mode you choose. There is a score and a table of high scores.

Since it's an Android Application it is implemented in Java and it uses Gradle to build the project. 
To run it you need an Android envoirenment, like a smartphone with a software version Android API 21, also known as Lollipop.
To compile the whole project you need 
	
	internal_impl-22.0.0.jar

	classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.1.0'
	
which are the libraries of gradle to build the project and an android's library.


The project was made by four people one year ago. The repository had 4 branches and 4 contributors all non active for a year until we made our branch. 
The description of the commits show us what functionalities have been added or what problems were fixed.
To make a commit you have to fork the original repository. When you make a change that is usefull to the project you make a pull request and the ''master'' decides if he wants to add your changes to the project or not.



To us it is a simple application and anyone can play its games. There are no major issues, just small issues that could be worked on, like a menu button on the highscore menu.
