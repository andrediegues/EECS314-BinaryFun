**Logical View**
The Logical View describes the internal structure of our system, the integrated parts and their relations.
The UML Diagrams allow us to do a model of the view of the system. We will use a Class Diagram to do so.

A class represents a group of objects with similar behaviour and caractheristics. 
Within a class have atributes and methods, atributes represent a propriety of a class defined by abstract terms and methods can modify the values of the atributes and change its status.

In our game we have the Main Activity class which is connected to the other classes. We have classes that represent the Learning modes and the Game modes.
