Since it's an Android Application it is implemented in Java and it uses Gradle to build the project. 
To run it you need an Android envoirenment, like a smartphone with a software version Android API 21, also known as Lollipop.
To compile the whole project you need 
	
	internal_impl-22.0.0.jar

	classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.1.0'
	
which are the libraries of gradle to build the project and an android's library.


The project was made by four people one year ago. The repository had 4 branches and 4 contributors all non active for a year until we made our branch. 
The description of the commits show us what functionalities have been added or what problems were fixed.
To make a commit you have to fork the original repository. When you make a change that is usefull to the project you make a pull request and the ''master'' decides if he wants to add your changes to the project or not.



To us it is a simple application and anyone can play its games. There are no major issues, just small issues that could be worked on, like a menu button on the highscore menu.
