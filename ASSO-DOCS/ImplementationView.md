**Implementation View**

Implementation View can be represented by a Component Diagram and describes system components. It shows us how the software interacts with the user.

In the game application the Main loads all the Libraries to launch the game. Once the game is running the player has to choose a PlayerMode (SinglePlayer or MultiPlayer). Afterwards he has to pick a game and in the end of the game the player can submit his score to the HighScore table which is connected locally if the player chose SinglePlayer otherwise it is connected to a server.
